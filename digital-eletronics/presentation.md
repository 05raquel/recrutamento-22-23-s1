# Electronics

## What is Electronics?

## Fundamental Notions and Laws in Electronics
There are three main notions to be understood in electronics:
	+ **Current->I**(SI: Ampere): The ordered flow of electrons, therefore electrical charge per time unit 
	+ **Electrical Tension or Potential Difference->U**(SI: Volt): The tension applied on said electrons, therefore energy per charge
	+ **Resistance->R**(SI: Ohm): The resistance of a medium to the electron flow


## Ohm's Law
We can describe the resistance as the tension we have to "apply" to push the electron flow establishing an equality-**Ohm's Law:**
$$ R=\frac{U}{I} $$

## Kirchhoff's Voltage Law

## Kirchhoff's Current Law

## Additional Notions and Fundamentals
Then we can also add some additional notions
	+ **Power**(SI: Watt): Rate of transference of electrical energy through a circuit, using the definition of Electrical Tension and current:
	$$ P=U\timesI $$
	+ **Capacitance**(SI: Farad): The ability of a material to store electrical charge. In a DC circuit:
	$$ C=\fraq{q}{U}
